Much like an OLTP system(database), an OLAP system(data warehouse) is also required to maintain a schema

➡️ Star Schema
✅ Each dimension is represented by only one dimension table
✅ The dimension tables are directly linked with the fact table
✅ Queries are not that complex because of straightforward joins.
✅ Simple queries result in the faster query response time
✅ Most widely used in the industry

➡️ Snowflake Schema
✅ The dimension table is split into sub-dimension tables
✅ Some dimensions are normalized to avoid redundancy of data
✅ Used when a dimension table starts growing at a higher rate

➡️ Galaxy Schema
✅ It is also called Fact Constellation Schema
✅ It has more than one fact
✅ It can be an extension of either star schema or snowflake schema
✅ The same dimension table can be shared between more than
one fact table
