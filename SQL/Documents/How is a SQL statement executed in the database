How is a SQL statement executed in the database?

The diagram below shows the process. Note that the architectures for different databases are different, the diagram demonstrates some common designs.

Step 1 - A SQL statement is sent to the database via a transport layer protocol (e.g.TCP).

Step 2 - The SQL statement is sent to the command parser, where it goes through syntactic and semantic analysis, and a query tree is generated afterward.

Step 3 - The query tree is sent to the optimizer. The optimizer creates an execution plan. 

Step 4 - The execution plan is sent to the executor. The executor retrieves data from the execution.

Step 5 - Access methods provide the data fetching logic required for execution, retrieving data from the storage engine. 

Step 6 - Access methods decide whether the SQL statement is read-only. If the query is read-only (SELECT statement), it is passed to the buffer manager for further processing. The buffer manager looks for the data in the cache or data files.

Step 7 - If the statement is an UPDATE or INSERT, it is passed to the transaction manager for further processing.

Step 8 - During a transaction, the data is in lock mode. This is guaranteed by the lock manager. It also ensures the transactionâ€™s ACID properties.
