Facebook SQL interview question

Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the average number of days between each user’s posts in the year 2021. Output the user and the average number of days they waited between posts.

Solution
------------
3 things I do whenever asked a SQL question in interview -
1. Read question MULTIPLE times
2. List down the expected output (this is the main part)
3. Break down the problem into smaller problems


Now, let's solve it!

✳️ STEP 1
Read question again-> Given users posts table, find AVG of (days) between EACH user's post in 2021. Post at least twice.

✳️ STEP 2
Comment expected output->
--user_id | avg(days btw each post)

Example: Let's say, User 1 posted on Aug 1, Aug 5, Aug 8. We need days between each post and then the average of days
-- userid | post_date | days |
-- 1 | 2021-08-01 | 0 |
-- 1 | 2021-08-05 | 4 |
-- 1 | 2021-08-08 | 3  |

✳️ Step 3
The sub problem now left to solve is ->
FIND the days between each post.

◉ To find days, we will use Lag(post_date,1). This gives the previous post date.
BUT there is an edge case here when the user post for first time there's NO previous_post_date. For this, we can filter using where difference is NOT NULL [SEE cte_2]

-- userid | post_date | lag(post_date,1) |
-- 1 | 2021-08-01 | NULL |
-- 1 | 2021-08-05 | 2021-08-01 |
-- 1 | 2021-08-08 | 2021-08-05 |
(cte_1 output)

◉ Take the difference (post_date - previous_post_date) where difference is NOT NULL (handling edge case stated above)

-- userid | post_date | lag(post_date,1) | days |
-- 1 | 2021-08-05 | 2021-08-01 | 4 |
-- 1 | 2021-08-08 | 2021-08-05 | 3 |
(cte_2 output)

◉ Finally, take the average of days and GROUP BY each USER_ID that posted at least twice
-- userid | avg(days)|
-- 1 | 153 days |
-- 2 | 103 days |
