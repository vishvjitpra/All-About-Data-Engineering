What is a Slowly Changing Dimension?

‚ú≥Ô∏èA Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) is a dimension that stores and manages both current and historical data over time in a data warehouse.
‚ú≥Ô∏èIt is considered and implemented as one of the most critical ETL tasks in tracking the history of dimension records.
‚ú≥Ô∏èThere are three types of SCDs and you can use Warehouse Builder to define, deploy, and load all three types of SCDs.

======================================
The three types of SCDs are:

üéØType 1 SCDs - "Overwriting":
‚è©In a Type 1 SCD the new data overwrites the existing data.
‚è©Thus the existing data is lost as it is not stored anywhere else.
‚è©This is the default type of dimension you create.
‚è©You do not need to specify any additional information to create a Type 1 SCD.

======================================

üéØType 2 SCDs - "Creating another dimension record":
‚è©A Type 2 SCD retains the full history of values.
‚è©When the value of a chosen attribute changes, the current record is closed.
‚è©A new record is created with the changed data values and this new record becomes the current record.
‚è©Each record contains the effective time and expiration time to identify the time period between which the record was active.
‚è©The advantage of this approach is that it allows you to track full history.
‚è©The disadvantage is that your dimension tables grow without limit and may become very large.
‚è©When you use Type 2 SCD you will also usually need to create additional reporting views to simplify the process of seeing only the latest dimension values.

======================================

üéØType 3 SCDs - "Creating a current value field"
‚è©A Type 3 SCD stores two versions of values for certain selected level attributes.
‚è©Each record stores the previous value and the current value of the selected attribute.
‚è©When the value of any of the selected attributes changes, the current value is stored as the old value and the new value becomes the current value.
‚è©The advantage of Type 3 is that you get some version history, but the dimension tables remain at the same size as the source system. You also won‚Äôt need to create additional reporting views.
‚è©The disadvantage is you get limited version history, usually only covering the most recent 2 or 3 changes.
